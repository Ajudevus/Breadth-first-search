# Breadth-first-search
 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm. It traverses the graph in a breadth wise or layer wise manner.
 BFS uses a queue to successfully traverse all the elements of a graph.
 The time complexity of dfs traversal is O(V+E) and space complexity is O(V)
 # Depth-First-search
 DFS is a graph traversal algorithm. It traverses the graph in a depth wise or height wise manner.
 DFS uses a stack to successfully traverse all the elements of a graph.
 The time complexity of dfs traversal is O(V+E) and space complexity is O(V)
